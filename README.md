# nOPV2 Distribution & Coverage Analysis

## Background
Novel Oral Polio Vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) is used in outbreak response to
circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).

## Objective
To assess distribution efficiency, coverage, and wastage of nOPV2 during
supplementary immunization activities.

## Data
Simulated district-level campaign data representing routine operational
indicators used in polio outbreak response.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and analysis using Python (pandas)
- Computation of coverage, utilization, and wastage indicators
- Descriptive and geographic analysis

## Key Findings
- National coverage exceeded 90%, with sub-national variability
- Districts with low utilization showed higher wastage rates
- Evidence of supply-demand mismatches in selected districts

## Recommendations
- Improve microplanning and demand forecasting
- Strengthen real-time vaccine logistics monitoring
- Target supportive supervision in underperforming areas
